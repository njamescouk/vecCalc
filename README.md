# vecCalc

Having recovered from the outrageous success of
[simplePathWriter](https://github.com/njamescouk/simplePathWriter),
which  I've probably used about three times in the last five years, I
grew  frustrated with it's limitations. Having tried and failed to do
geometry  with it I trawled around and found some remarkable software
for doing  the necessary. However these packages involved learning
curves and some pretty  idiosyncratic UI misfeatures. One, which
really produces the goods, has  a theorem prover attached, which is
way over my pay grade.

So here we are: yet another not invented here lash up! This one is 
lightweight, unsuprising and programmer friendly. It produces `.svg` 
files of simple (no curves) geometrical figures from an equally simple 
text specification. This means the figures are easily and accurately 
editable and reproducible.

Enjoy!
